# Vividological

Weaponry, tools, foods, trees, and capitalism! Made for Failed Voyage SMP.

Vividological is a work-in-progress mod for **Fabric 1.21.1** adding new materials, new weapons and tools, new foods, and ways to create an economy.

There's no guidebook (yet), so \[insert recipe viewer of choice here] will be your friend!

Depends on [Trinkets](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets), Lychee, and Fabric API.

Contains optional integration with [Tweakfailure](https://github.com/Chemthunder/tweakfailure-1.21.1)
